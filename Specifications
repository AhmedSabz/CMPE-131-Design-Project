Abstract:
What are you asking: 
We are creating an all in one fitness interface that will guide and support user’s fitness and health journeys by placing a focus on weight management. The features included in the app will include a unique calorie tracking system and personalized workout routines based on the user's weight goals. 
Why is it important: 
This interface will allow users to keep track of both nutrition and exercise all under one website/app which makes access to information much easier for the user. The features of the interface help motivate users to reach their nutritional and fitness goals.   
How will you develop it: 
This website will involve various features useful for a user’s health and fitness journey bringing a focus on weight management. The product development side will have an equal emphasis on the front and back end as we will prioritize an easy and efficient and user friendly experience along with advanced features. In the higher-level we will need to use HTML, CSS and javascript to create the GUI. Given our group’s engineering background, we will need to draw on our  C++ experience to pick up Python. With that being said, since this project needs to be completed by the end of the semester we will focus on implementing the core features along with a straightforward UI with open source softwares such as react.js, angular, Vue.js, Node.js, and Flask. 
Why are the results useful: 
The results will allow the user to stick to a specific meal plan allowing the user to be physically fit. The successful results will prompt the user to share this application with his or her friends which would help us monetize this application.
List of Requirements:
Profile management : The user profile will include age, weight, height, and BMI. Additionally, the user will be allowed to input their personal goals. 
Calorie tracking : The calorie tracker will set a daily calorie aim based on the user's weight goals. By scanning nutrition labels, users can have a swift way of inputting their calories and determining whether they are able to meet their goals.
Weight tracking : As the user begins their health journey, they can track their progress through engaging visuals like graphs and charts that show weight changes over time. 
Workout routine: An extremely important component in weight management is also exercise, so the interface will also customize workout routines from an extensive fitness repository. 
Notifications: To keep users on track with their fitness and health goals, they can opt for reminders to get in their calories or exercise.
